for our stuff:
//do c. make whatever unused word up, add a if condition with !c.whateverword and set it to true inside the function.
    
if (this.randomShit === "blah blah" && !c.whateverWord) {
      this.sendMessage("I ARE PRO!!1!");
      c.whateverWord = true;
      }//or, if you want it to be based on entity and not a global thing:
    if (c.ruh && !this.whateverWord) {
      this.sendMessage("Reeeee");
      this.whateverWord = true;
      }
